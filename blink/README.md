# blink
Funny blink animation to show object oriented approach.

## Folders
The following folders are automatically generated by STM32CubeMX software.
- __Drivers__
- __Inc__
- __Middlewares__
- __Src__

The only thing I added is the `App_createStatic()` call in `Src/main.c` to enter my framework. To seperate my code I put everything in a seperate folder:
- __App__
